EE219 - PROJECT 1
===

Hi! This is the repo of EE219 project 1. There are several files in this repo which you may find help.

#### `NBD_Task_2_a.R`

This R file is for Task 2 (a). R is a very useful language that can provide the p-value along with linear model fitting. There maybe some problems if you choose R for this assignment. We can discuss about that.

#### `data.csv` and `network_backup_dataset.csv`
 `network_backup_dataset.csv` are the original dataset. `data.csv` has same data entries as  `network_backup_dataset.csv` but the attributes names (columns names) are modified for input convenience.

#### `n1_plot.py`
This contains the code for Task 1 of this project. And the `NBD_Task1.png` is the output of this piece of code. You can refer to it to get some insight (if it can help).

#### `tools.py`
I wrote two functions here for general use.

Good luck with our group.
